--some guy requested was originally found (to my understanding) by scarz ofc knowing how to do it its easy to recreate something so simple

game:GetService("Players").GeneralofAR.PlayerGui.MapSelection.Frame.Launcher.Hardcore.Description.Purchase.Visible = false

game:GetService("Players").GeneralofAR.PlayerGui.MapSelection.Frame.Launcher.Hardcore.Description.Play.Visible = true

-- yes it was controlled by a simple gui,



--[[

HOW TO USE:

run this script while in lobby and have hardcore selected then press play

(if we ever get a cheap bypass to roblox anti cheat at least)
